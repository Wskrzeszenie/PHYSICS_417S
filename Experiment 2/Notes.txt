Mysterious Peak before 14.4 keV
- All peaks above 14.4 keV come from the nucleus directly
- Lower-energy peaks come from conversion and Auger electrons that scatter following absorption

Time uncertainty:

measure delta n from top 1/4 to bottom 1/4 drop, multiplied by 70 us bin size to get time uncertainty

should be small
